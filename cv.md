# Curriculum Vitae

## Current Role

Independent software engineer developing open-source tools for network automation and intelligent systems.

## Education

**PhD, Computer Science**
University of South Australia, 2017

Thesis: *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*

Developed compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into multi-platform device configurations. Research focused on graph transformations, declarative network modeling, and automated configuration generation across heterogeneous vendors. Created AutoNetkit, which was integrated into Cisco's VIRL network simulation platform and presented at PyCon Australia 2013.

## Professional Work

**Independent Software Engineer** (2024-Present)
*Distributed Systems & Network Automation*
- Developing **ank_pydantic**, a high-performance network topology modeling framework with a Rust core (`petgraph`) and Python bindings (`PyO3`), used for large-scale network simulation and validation.
- Built **NetVis**, a deterministic topology layout engine that transforms complex multi-layer network graphs into information-dense visualizations for engineering analysis.
- Implementing **Agentic Systems**, a security-first multi-agent framework utilizing NATS and Docker for isolated, capability-based automation in personal and production environments.
- Collaborating on the **HealthyPi Ecosystem**, developing real-time biometric signal processing pipelines (ECG, PPG, HRV) for experimental health monitoring hardware.

**AutoNetkit - Cisco VIRL Integration** (2013-2017)
Open-source network configuration automation tool developed during PhD research. Integrated into Cisco's Virtual Internet Routing Lab (VIRL) platform for automated multi-vendor network lab provisioning. Presented at PyCon Australia 2013. Supported major vendors including Cisco IOS, IOS-XR, NX-OS, Juniper JunOS, and Arista EOS.

**Internet Topology Zoo** (2010-2013)
Curated database of real-world network topologies from Internet service providers, research networks, and enterprise deployments. Widely used dataset in academic research for network analysis, algorithm validation, and simulation studies.
