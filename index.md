# About Me

I'm a software engineer and researcher focused on building intelligent systems with strong security and performance guarantees. My work spans **multi-agent architectures**, **network automation**, and **real-time signal processing**—with an emphasis on production-ready implementations that demonstrate how AI agents can be deployed in security-critical environments.

## Current Focus

I'm currently developing several interconnected projects that explore **agent-based systems** for personal infrastructure:

- Building a **security-first multi-agent system** where containerized agents communicate through validated message queues, demonstrating zero-trust isolation patterns
- Creating **health monitoring tools** that transform biometric data from HealthyPi hardware into actionable insights through agentic intelligence
- Developing an **autonomous SIGINT platform** for radio spectrum monitoring with ML-based signal classification
- Exploring **AI-driven training systems** that connect hardware (KICKR Core) to agent orchestration

My development philosophy emphasizes **modular architecture**, **message-bus coordination** (NATS), **comprehensive testing**, and **systematic planning** through structured roadmaps and verification loops.

## Background

I completed my **PhD at the University of South Australia** in 2017, researching automated network configuration generation. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, presented a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into device configurations across multiple platforms and protocols.

The work produced **AutoNetkit**, an open-source tool written in Python that's been used in Cisco's VIRL project and by network engineers in industry. I presented this work at PyCon AU 2013 ([recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ)).

## Research Interests

- **Agent Security**: Zero-trust multi-agent architectures with capability-based authorization
- **Health Informatics**: Real-time biometric analysis and virtual patient simulation
- **Network Automation**: High-level abstractions for infrastructure configuration
- **Signal Intelligence**: Autonomous spectrum monitoring and ML-based signal classification
