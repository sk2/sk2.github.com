# Simon Knight, PhD

I specialize in the architecture of intelligent systems and network automation. My work bridges the gap between high-level intent and low-level execution through formal modeling, deterministic simulation, and multi-agent coordination.

## Core Expertise

My work centers on building the right abstractions and transformations for complex systems:

- **Systems Design:** Emphasizing systematic planning, type-safe interfaces, and comprehensive test coverage as first-class citizens. Designing systems that transform high-level intent into executable implementations through well-defined layers of abstraction.
- **Network Automation:** Developing Rust-native engines for topology modeling, protocol simulation, and configuration generation. Building tools that enable declarative network design with multi-vendor support.
- **Advanced Data Visualization and Analytics:** Creating information-dense visualizations that reduce complexity and reveal structure. Processing large-scale geospatial and network datasets with Rust/Polars analytics pipelines.
- **Signal Processing:** Building modular ecosystems for real-time RF spectrum monitoring and analysis through SDR acquisition pipelines and spatial audio processing.
- **Agent Architectures:** Designing secure, message-bus-driven multi-agent systems with strong isolation boundaries and deterministic behavior.

I focus on building tools that solve the "information noise" problem—transforming complex, raw data into clear, actionable visualizations and configurations through well-designed abstractions.

## Research & Background

I completed my PhD at the University of South Australia in 2017. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, pioneered a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into multi-platform device configurations.

This research led to the creation of **AutoNetkit**, an open-source tool integrated into Cisco's VIRL platform for automated network lab provisioning. I continue to evolve these abstractions in my current projects.

## Featured Projects

- **[Network Simulator:](/projects/network-simulator)** A Rust-based packet-level network simulator with daemon mode, interactive console, SR-MPLS dataplane, and L3VPN support. 130,000+ LOC, 1,350+ tests.
- **[Network Visualization Engine:](/projects/netvis)** A Rust visualization engine that turns complex multi-layer topologies into clear, information-dense renderings with isometric views and edge bundling.
- **[Signal Processing & SDR:](/signal-processing)** Real-time spectrum monitoring (Project Spectra), Multi-SDR Streaming Server, and experimental RF signal reflection analysis.
