# Simon Knight, PhD

I specialize in the architecture of intelligent systems and network automation. My work bridges the gap between high-level intent and low-level execution through formal modeling, deterministic simulation, and multi-agent coordination.

## Core Expertise

My work centers on building the right abstractions and transformations for complex systems:

- **Systems Design:** Emphasizing systematic planning, type-safe interfaces, and comprehensive test coverage as first-class citizens. Designing systems that transform high-level intent into executable implementations through well-defined layers of abstraction.
- **Network Automation:** Developing high-performance Rust engines for topology modeling, protocol simulation, and configuration generation. Building tools that enable declarative network design with multi-vendor support.
- **Advanced Data Visualization and Analytics:** Creating information-dense visualizations that reduce complexity and reveal structure. Processing large-scale geospatial and network datasets with high-performance analytics pipelines.
- **Signal Processing:** Building modular ecosystems for real-time RF spectrum monitoring and analysis. Integrating with biometric platforms like HealthyPi for automated health insights.
- **Agent Architectures:** Designing secure, message-bus-driven multi-agent systems with strong isolation boundaries and deterministic behavior.

I focus on building tools that solve the "information noise" problem—transforming complex, raw data into clear, actionable visualizations and configurations through well-designed abstractions.

## Research & Background

I completed my PhD at the University of South Australia in 2017. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, pioneered a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into multi-platform device configurations.

This research led to the creation of **AutoNetkit**, an open-source tool used by Cisco's VIRL project for large-scale network simulation. I have presented this work at PyCon AU and continue to evolve these abstractions in my current projects.

## Active Projects

I am currently developing a suite of interconnected tools:

- **NetVis:** A high-performance visualization engine for complex network topologies.
- **ank-pydantic:** Type-safe topology modeling backed by a Rust graph core.
- **Secure Multi-Agent Assistant:** A containerized agent framework for secure automation.
- **Biometric Analysis Tools:** Building agent-based analysis systems on top of the HealthyPi hardware platform for automated health insights.

## Technical Skills

| Domain | Primary Tools & Languages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Rust (System performance), Python (Rapid modeling), Go (Services & tooling), TypeScript |

## Development Workflow

I maintain a high-velocity development environment focused on deep work and deterministic results. My toolchain centers on `nvim` and a suite of specialized LLM-integrated agents. I employ the GSD (Get Stuff Done) workflow to ensure architectural integrity through systematic planning and automated verification.
