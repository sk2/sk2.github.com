# About Me

I build intelligent systems with strong security and performance guarantees. My work focuses on multi-agent architectures, network automation, and real-time signal processing.

## Current Work

I develop agent-based systems for personal infrastructure:

- A multi-agent system where containerized agents communicate through validated message queues
- Health monitoring tools that transform HealthyPi biometric data into insights
- An autonomous platform for radio spectrum monitoring with ML-based signal classification
- AI-driven training systems connecting hardware to agent orchestration

I emphasize modular architecture, message-bus coordination (NATS), comprehensive testing, and systematic planning through structured roadmaps.

## Background

I completed my PhD at the University of South Australia in 2017. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, presented a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into device configurations.

The work produced AutoNetkit, an open-source Python tool used in Cisco's VIRL project. I presented this work at PyCon AU 2013 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ)).

## Research Interests

- Agent security and zero-trust multi-agent architectures
- Real-time biometric analysis and virtual patient simulation
- Network automation with high-level abstractions
- Autonomous spectrum monitoring and ML-based signal classification
