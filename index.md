# About Me

I build network automation tools and intelligent systems. My work focuses on network configuration generation, topology modeling, and multi-agent architectures.

## Current Work

I develop tools for network engineering and agent-based systems:

- Network topology generators, simulators, and visualization libraries in Rust
- Type-safe network modeling with Pydantic and Rust-backed graph engines
- Multi-agent systems with security-first message bus architectures
- Astrophotography control systems and biometric analysis tools

I work independently on open-source projects. I emphasize systematic planning, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation.

## Background

I completed my PhD at the University of South Australia in 2017. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, presented a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into device configurations.

The work produced AutoNetkit, an open-source Python tool used in Cisco's VIRL project. I presented this work at PyCon AU 2013 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ)).

## Research Interests
