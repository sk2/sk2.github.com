# About Me

I build network automation tools and intelligent systems. My work focuses on network configuration generation, topology modeling, and multi-agent architectures.

## Current Work

I develop tools for network engineering and agent-based systems:

- Network topology generators, simulators, and visualization libraries in Rust
- Type-safe network modeling with Pydantic and Rust-backed graph engines
- Multi-agent systems with security-first message bus architectures
- Astrophotography control systems and biometric analysis tools

I work independently on open-source projects. I emphasize systematic planning, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation.

## Technical Skills

### Languages

| Language   | Status                                      |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Primary                                     |
| Rust       | Increasing focus                            |
| JavaScript | UI work (React), mostly automated           |
| Go         | Several projects, may return to             |

### Areas of Focus

- Software and platform architecture
- Systems design and network automation
- Data integration and analysis
- ML integration (expanding)

## Tools & Workflow

### Development Environment
- **Editor:** nvim with Neophyte
- **AI Assistants:** Ghostie (primary), alternating between Codex, OpenCode, Claude Code, Gemini
- **Knowledge Management:** Obsidian with Agent plugin

### Productivity
- **Planning:** GSD workflow (also exploring Superpowers)
- **Voice Input:** Wispr Flow
- **Quick Access:** Claude Menu Bar

## Background

I completed my PhD at the University of South Australia in 2017. My thesis, *Abstractions and Transformations for Automated Data Network Configuration*, presented a compiler-based approach to transform high-level network specifications into device configurations.

The work produced AutoNetkit, an open-source Python tool for network configuration automation. I presented this work at PyCon AU 2013 ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ)).

## Research Interests

- Network automation and high-level configuration abstractions
- Network topology generation, simulation, and visualization
- Multi-agent architectures and message-based coordination
- Biometric signal processing and RF spectrum analysis

## Outside Technology

### Active Pursuits
- **Photography & Astrophotography** (related projects in development)
- **Mountain Biking**
- **Yoga** (yin yoga and vinyasa)
- **Soccer**

### Creative & Contemplative
- **Music** (projects coming soon)
- **Insight Meditation** (theory and practice)
