# Projects

My work focuses on network automation tools, signal processing systems, and multi-agent architectures.

---

## Network Engineering

### [WatchNoise](projects/watchnoise)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 6/7 (100%)</span>

Convenient access to sleep sounds from your wrist without needing your phone nearby.

---

### [ank_pydantic](projects/ank-pydantic)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 58/62 (99%)</span>

A clean, consistent API where there's one obvious way to perform each topology operation — predictable naming, return types, and method signatures across the entire public surface.

---

### [ank_workbench](projects/ank-workbench)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 16/19 (100%)</span>

Network engineers can design, validate, and visualize network changes in one complete workflow without switching between separate tools or manually gluing components together.

---

### [nascleanup](projects/nascleanup)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>



---

### [netvis](projects/netvis)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Transform network topologies into clear, information-dense visualizations using algorithms that minimize edge crossings, bundle related connections, and respect hierarchical/geographic structure — enabling understanding of networks that would otherwise be visual noise.

---

### [network-simulator](projects/network-simulator)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Validate network configurations at scale with protocol-level fidelity before deploying to real infrastructure.

---

### [photo-tour](projects/photo-tour)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

In the field, you can see what the camera sees and get actionable guidance/control fast enough to improve the shot.

---

### [signals](projects/signals)

<span class="status-badge status-complete">Production Ready</span>

Transform raw radio spectrum data into an actionable "Signal Census" through automated detection, ML classification, and distributed acquisition.

---

### [tileserver](projects/tileserver)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Serve dynamic vector tiles (MVT) from massive geospatial datasets (millions of points) with sub-second latency, enabling interactive visualization in Kepler.gl without pre-rendering static tilesets.

---

### [topogen](projects/topogen)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 15/15 (100%)</span>

Network engineers can quickly generate realistic, validated network topologies without implementing complex algorithms from scratch.

---

## Signal Processing & Hardware

### [healthypi](projects/healthypi)

<span class="status-badge status-complete">Production Ready</span>

A modular, agent-aware health monitoring ecosystem that translates raw biometric data from HealthyPi hardware (6 and Move) into actionable insights and automated interventions.

---

### [open-astro-core](projects/open-astro-core)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Downstream apps can rely on correct, consistent coordinate math and device/protocol primitives.

---

### [open-astro-node](projects/open-astro-node)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

A headless, autonomous astrophotography controller designed for low-power Linux devices (RPi/Jetson). It manages hardware, executes imaging sequences, and ensures rig safety.

---

## AI & Agents

### [cycle](projects/cycle)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 1/5 (80%)</span>

A native SwiftUI training application for iPad and Apple TV that bridges professional cycling hardware (KICKR Core) with dynamic AI-driven workout logic via NATS, visualized in a high-performance SceneKit environment.

---

### [multi-agent-assistant](projects/multi-agent-assistant)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 17/20 (79%)</span>

Complete isolation between agents such that compromise of one agent cannot cascade to others or the orchestrator—demonstrating that secure multi-agent systems are practical for both personal and production infrastructure use cases.

---

## Development Approach

I plan work in `.planning/` directories with phase-based execution. I document architecture decisions in PROJECT.md and STATE.md.
