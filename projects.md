# Projects

My work focuses on network automation tools, signal processing systems, and multi-agent architectures.

---

## [ANK Workbench](projects/ank-workbench)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 17/19 (99%)</span>

**Stack:** Python backend (FastAPI or Flask) · React or Vue frontend — Leverages existing Python ecosystem for ANK components · meets modern UX expectations

Network engineers can design, validate, and visualize network changes in one complete workflow without switching between separate tools or manually gluing components together.


## [ASIAIR Import Tool](projects/import-asiair)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 1/1 (0%)</span>

Eliminates manual file sorting after imaging sessions - scan hundreds of frames, organize by target/filter/date, validate calibration frame availability, and go straight to PixInsight processing.


## [AutoNetkit](projects/autonetkit)

<span class="status-badge status-active">PhD 2017</span>

**Stack:** Python


## [Cycle Agent](projects/cycle)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 1/5 (80%)</span>

A native SwiftUI training application for iPad and Apple TV that bridges professional cycling hardware (KICKR Core) with dynamic AI-driven workout logic via NATS, visualized in a high-performance S...


## [HealthyPi Ecosystem](projects/healthypi)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

A modular, agent-aware health monitoring ecosystem that translates raw biometric data from HealthyPi hardware (6 and Move) into actionable insights and automated interventions.


## [NetVis](projects/netvis)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Transform network topologies into clear, information-dense visualizations using algorithms that minimize edge crossings, bundle related connections, and respect hierarchical/geographic structure — ...


## [Network Simulator](projects/network-simulator)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Validate network configurations at scale with protocol-level fidelity before deploying to real infrastructure.


## [OpenAstro Core](projects/open-astro-core)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Downstream apps can rely on correct, consistent coordinate math and device/protocol primitives.


## [OpenAstro Node](projects/open-astro-node)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

A headless, autonomous astrophotography controller designed for low-power Linux devices (RPi/Jetson). It manages hardware, executes imaging sequences, and ensures rig safety.


## [Passive Radar - KrakenSDR Multi-Beam System](projects/passive)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 1/3 (5%)</span>

Clean, understandable, stable codebase that reliably tracks aircraft in real-time.


## [Photo Tour](projects/photo-tour)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

In the field, you can see what the camera sees and get actionable guidance/control fast enough to improve the shot.


## [Project Spectra](projects/signals)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Transform raw radio spectrum data into an actionable "Signal Census" through automated detection, ML classification, and distributed acquisition.


## [Secure Multi-Agent Personal Assistant](projects/multi-agent)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 17/20 (79%)</span>

Complete isolation between agents such that compromise of one agent cannot cascade to others or the orchestrator—demonstrating that secure multi-agent systems are practical for both personal and pr...


## [Tileserver Polars](projects/tileserver)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Serve dynamic vector tiles (MVT) from massive geospatial datasets (millions of points) with sub-second latency, enabling interactive visualization in Kepler.gl without pre-rendering static tilesets.


## [TopoGen - Network Topology Generator](projects/topogen)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Network engineers can quickly generate realistic, validated network topologies without implementing complex algorithms from scratch.


## [WatchNoise](projects/watchnoise)

<span class="status-badge status-active">v1.1 Shipped</span>

**Stack:** Swift (SwiftUI)

An Apple Watch sleep sounds application featuring adaptive audio. It uses a custom audio unit graph for real-time synthesis and integrates with HealthKit for heart rate synchronization.


## [Wave](projects/watch-noise)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

- **StillState:** Reclaiming silence and rest in shared or noisy environments through intelligent, adaptive audio.
- **FlowState:** Achieving and maintaining a "Steady State" of focus through task-...


## [Wi-Fi Radar](projects/wifi-radar)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

Passive radar system that utilizes existing Wi-Fi signals for through-wall human detection and localization, leveraging the KrakenSDR coherent radio array.


## [ank_pydantic](projects/ank-pydantic)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Phase 58/62 (99%)</span>

A clean, consistent API where there's one obvious way to perform each topology operation — predictable naming, return types, and method signatures across the entire public surface.


## [nascleanup](projects/nascleanup)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active Development</span>

**Stack:** Rust

A Rust-based CLI tool for deduplicating and organizing large file shares. Optimized for Docker execution on DSM, it uses an indexing layer for fast file comparison and metadata management.


## [netsim](projects/netsim)

<span class="status-badge status-active">Active</span>

A deterministic, tick-based network protocol simulator for validating configurations. It provides protocol-level fidelity with guaranteed reproducibility, allowing engineers to detect routing loops...
