## The Insight

A clean, consistent API where there's one obvious way to perform each topology operation — predictable naming, return types, and method signatures across the entire public surface.

## What This Is

A Python library for modeling and querying network topologies, backed by a high-performance Rust core (`ank_nte`). Features a two-stage transformation model (Whiteboard → Plan → Protocol Layers), type-safe Pydantic models for nodes/edges/layers, and a composable lazy query API with Rust-backed execution. Ships with "batteries-included" domain models (ISIS, MPLS, EVPN, L3VPN, IXP) in the blueprints/ module.
