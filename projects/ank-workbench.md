## The Insight

Network design, validation, and testing typically occur in fragmented tools. **ANK Workbench** unifies these into a declarative "Source of Truth" workflow. It replaces VM-heavy emulators with lightweight simulations and high-fidelity visualizations, focusing on network intent rather than hardware emulation.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Phase 18/19 (98%) |
| **Language** | Python backend (FastAPI or Flask), React or Vue frontend — Leverages existing Python ecosystem for ANK components, meets modern UX expectations |
| **Started** | 2026 |

## What This Is

A web-based platform that integrates the entire network automation ecosystem into a single workflow. Upload topology YAML, visualize the network, run simulations, and analyze results without switching between tools.

## Key Features

- **Unified Web Interface**: React/Vue frontend with modern UX
- **Topology Management**: Import, edit, and version control network designs
- **Integrated Simulation**: One-click validation with netsim
- **Live Visualization**: Interactive topology rendering with NetVis
- **Results Analysis**: Compare configuration states, routing tables, and protocol behavior

## Current Status

Near production-ready. Core integration complete, polishing UI/UX and adding advanced workflow features.

## Tech Stack

Python backend (FastAPI/Flask), React or Vue frontend, integrates all ANK ecosystem components
