## The Concept

Network design, validation, and testing typically occur in fragmented tools. **ANK Workbench** unifies these into a declarative "Source of Truth" workflow. It replaces VM-heavy emulators with lightweight simulations and high-fidelity visualizations, focusing on network intent rather than hardware emulation.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Phase 18/19 (98%) |
| **Language** | Python backend (FastAPI or Flask), React or Vue frontend — Leverages existing Python ecosystem for ANK components, meets modern UX expectations |
| **Started** | 2026 |

## What This Is

A unified network simulation and visualization platform for enterprise network engineers. ANK Workbench integrates existing ANK Pydantic models, simulator, and visualization components into a seamless end-to-end workflow.

Engineers can design networks declaratively, run lightweight simulations, and visualize topology, configuration state, and simulation results in one integrated environment. Complements existing network tools by providing a declarative, intent-based workflow alongside traditional emulation platforms.
