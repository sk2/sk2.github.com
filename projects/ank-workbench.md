## The Insight

Network engineering is often fragmented—you design in a drawing tool, validate in a spreadsheet, and test in a separate lab. **ANK Workbench** unifies these into a single "Source of Truth" workflow. By integrating declarative modeling, real-time simulation, and high-fidelity visualization, it provides a modern alternative to VM-heavy emulators, focusing on the *intent* of the network rather than just the hardware.

## Core Value

Design, validate, and visualize network changes in one workflow without switching tools or manual integration.

## v1.1 Features (Feb 9, 2026)

- Persistent help system: non-modal drawer, 16 contextual tips, route-aware visibility.
- Sample gallery: 5 offline topologies (2-node starter to 12-node spine-leaf DC).
- Intelligent empty states: cause-specific, outcome preview pattern.
- Guided tour: 8-step workflow coverage with CSS-only spotlight.
- Production-ready onboarding: 101 files modified, 30 commits, 50/50 audit score.

## Workflow

Declarative Pydantic models → lightweight simulation → integrated topology/config/behavior visualization.

## What This Is

A unified network simulation and visualization platform for enterprise network engineers. ANK Workbench integrates existing ANK Pydantic models, simulator, and visualization components into a seamless end-to-end workflow. Engineers can design networks declaratively, run lightweight simulations, and visualize topology, configuration state, and simulation results in one integrated environment. Built as a commercial product offering a modern alternative to traditional emulation-based tools like GNS3 and Cisco Modeling Labs.
