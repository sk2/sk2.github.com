## The Insight

Network engineering is often fragmented—you design in a drawing tool, validate in a spreadsheet, and test in a separate lab. **ANK Workbench** unifies these into a single "Source of Truth" workflow. By integrating declarative modeling, real-time simulation, and high-fidelity visualization, it provides a modern alternative to VM-heavy emulators, focusing on the *intent* of the network rather than just the hardware.

## Quick Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Phase 16/19 (100%) |
| **Language** | Python backend (FastAPI or Flask), React or Vue frontend — Leverages existing Python ecosystem for ANK components, meets modern UX expectations |
| **Started** | 2025 |

## What This Is

A unified network simulation and visualization platform for enterprise network engineers. ANK Workbench integrates existing ANK Pydantic models, simulator, and visualization components into a seamless end-to-end workflow. Engineers can design networks declaratively, run lightweight simulations, and visualize topology, configuration state, and simulation results in one integrated environment. Built as a commercial product offering a modern alternative to traditional emulation-based tools like GNS3 and Cisco Modeling Labs.
