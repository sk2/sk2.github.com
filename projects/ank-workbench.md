## Core Value

Network engineers can design, validate, and visualize network changes in one complete workflow without switching between separate tools or manually gluing components together.

## What This Is

A unified network simulation and visualization platform for enterprise network engineers. ANK Workbench integrates existing ANK Pydantic models, simulator, and visualization components into a seamless end-to-end workflow. Engineers can design networks declaratively, run lightweight simulations, and visualize topology, configuration state, and simulation results in one integrated environment. Built as a commercial product offering a modern alternative to traditional emulation-based tools like GNS3 and Cisco Modeling Labs.
