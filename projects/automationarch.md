## What This Is

This project aims to comprehensively define the **overall architecture of the Network Automation Ecosystem**. This involves understanding how the existing and planned tools (such as `topogen`, `autonetkit`, `netsim`, `netflowsim`, `netvis`, and the `Workbench`), along with strategic initiatives like the "Intelligence Layer," integrate to form a cohesive, unified, and differentiated product.

The output of this project will be a clearer, more formalized architectural understanding, enabling the identification and discussion of future sub-projects that contribute to the ecosystem's evolution.
