## The Insight

Extract network-level topology relationships (protocol adjacencies, link roles, VLAN membership) from vendor-specific CLI and documentation with high accuracy, enabling truly vendor-independent network configuration.

## What This Is

A network automation framework that decouples network configuration from vendor-specific syntax. It uses LLM-powered RAG to extract network-level intent and topology relationships from vendor documentation and CLI configurations, normalizing them into a vendor-neutral topology graph model inspired by AutoNetKit. The system enables cross-vendor configuration generation and validation through semantic simulation.
