## The Insight

Reliability and autonomy for a "one-shot" astronomical event. The system handles guiding, exposure ramping (Holy Grail), and error recovery (watchdogs) so the photographer can experience the eclipse while the system secures the data.

## What This Is

A "fire and forget" Raspberry Pi-based controller for autonomous solar eclipse photography. It coordinates a camera (via gphoto2) and a high-end mount (ZWO AM5 / Benro Polaris via INDI) to capture a complete eclipse sequence from C1 to C4 without manual intervention.

## Core Value

Reliability and autonomy for a "one-shot" astronomical event. The system handles guiding, exposure ramping (Holy Grail), and error recovery (watchdogs) so the photographer can experience the eclipse while the system secures the data.
