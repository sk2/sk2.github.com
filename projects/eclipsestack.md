## What This Is

EclipseStack is a Rust-powered utility (with a web-based UI) specifically designed to align hundreds of RAW solar eclipse images taken during totality. It addresses the challenge of tracker drift by combining image feature detection (solar disk and flares) with temporal extrapolation based on EXIF data. The goal is to produce a perfectly aligned set of frames ready for HDR stacking in professional tools like PixInsight.

## Core Value

Enable high-fidelity HDR solar composites by providing sub-pixel alignment of eclipse frames through a combination of computer vision and temporal drift modeling.
