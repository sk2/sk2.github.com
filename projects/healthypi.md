## The Insight

Health monitoring is often trapped in silos—either raw sensor data that is hard to interpret or consumer apps that offer "scores" without transparency. The **HealthyPi Ecosystem** treats biometrics as a stream of events for an intelligent agent. By integrating research-grade signal processing (HRV, EDA, ECG) with a multi-agent message bus, it turns a Raspberry Pi into an autonomous health observer capable of real-time intervention and longitudinal analysis.
