## What This Is

A Python script that automates post-imaging-session file organization for astrophotography. It batch-imports FITS files from ASIAIR backup locations, organizes them by target and observation night, copies matching calibration frames, and prepares the directory structure for PixInsight's WBPP (Weighted Batch Preprocessing) workflow.
