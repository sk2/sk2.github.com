## The Insight

Complete isolation between agents such that compromise of one agent cannot cascade to others or the orchestrator—demonstrating that secure multi-agent systems are practical for both personal and production infrastructure use cases.

## What This Is

A security-first multi-agent system that coordinates specialized containerized agents (health monitoring, home automation, data aggregation, workflow automation) through a message broker architecture. Each agent runs in isolation with minimal privileges and communicates only through validated message queues, demonstrating production-ready patterns for deploying AI agents in security-critical infrastructure environments. The orchestrator uses cloud LLM reasoning (GPT-4/Claude) while agents remain lightweight and deterministic.
