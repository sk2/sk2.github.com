## The Insight

`netflowsim` provides rapid, massive-scale network performance analysis by using analytic queuing models and Monte Carlo simulations instead of packet-level discrete event simulation. It enables network engineers to validate topologies and routing strategies against billions of flow iterations in seconds.
