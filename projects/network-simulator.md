## What This Is

A Rust-based network simulator that models packet-level behavior for routing protocols. It provides a middle ground between pure algorithmic analysis (like C-BGP) and full emulation (like Containerlab) — larger scale and smaller footprint than emulation, higher fidelity than algorithmic simulation. Used for smoke testing and design validation of network configurations.

**Current state:** v1.5 shipped. Planning v1.6.
**Future Roadmap Ideas:** See [.planning/FUTURE_IDEAS.md](FUTURE_IDEAS.md) for long-term innovation and technical debt backlog.
