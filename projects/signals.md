## What This Is

A high-performance SDR client for spectrum monitoring and automated signal discovery. Spectra transforms raw IQ samples into a "Signal Census" through automated detection, ML classification, and distributed acquisition.

The system provides both high-level signal census data and low-level waterfall analysis for deep-dive signal inspection.
