## The Insight

Transform raw radio spectrum data into an actionable "Signal Census" through automated detection, ML classification, and distributed acquisition.

*Real-time signal detection showing frequency, bandwidth, modulation type, and classification confidence across the RF spectrum*

### Live Capture Example
