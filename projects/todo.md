## The Insight

Process an inbox full of captures into correctly-organized next actions (project + tags + defer/due) at high speed, with sub-second interactions.

## What This Is

A fast, keyboard-driven Rust text UI (TUI) task manager inspired by OmniFocus, built around a GTD workflow. It stores data in an owned SQLite database, supports projects and hierarchical contexts/tags, and is optimized for rapid inbox processing (triage + tagging) with minimal friction.

An OmniFocus 4 `.ofocus-package` importer provides one-time migration into the local database so the tool can replace OmniFocus for day-to-day use.
