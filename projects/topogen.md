## What This Is

A Rust-based network topology generator with Python bindings that consolidates scattered topology generation logic from AutoNetKit, simulation tools, and visualization tools. Generates realistic data center, WAN, and random graph topologies with proper structure, design patterns, and realistic parameters. Outputs custom YAML format for use across the network engineering tool ecosystem.
