## The Insight

- **StillState:** Reclaiming silence and rest in shared or noisy environments through intelligent, adaptive audio
- **FlowState:** Achieving and maintaining a "Steady State" of focus through task-linked audio and genetic evolution

## What This Is

**Wave** is an evolutionary ambient audio ecosystem designed to manage the user's sensory environment across rest and work.

1. **StillState (Watch):** An adaptive sleep sounds app for Apple Watch with personalized frequency calibration, heartbeat synchronization, and microphone-based environmental monitoring.
2. **FlowState (Mac):** A productivity-focused menu bar app that links procedural audio to the user's active tasks and "Genetic System" TODO list (planned).

## Use Cases

**StillState:** Sleeping on retreats or in shared dorms. Block human-centric noises (snoring) while respecting "noble silence" (no light/no watch speaker), with personalized frequency bias and optional heartbeat grounding.

**FlowState (Planned):** Deep work sessions at a desk. Noise serves as a "Flow State" trigger linked directly to productivity metrics and task DNA.
