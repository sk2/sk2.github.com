## What This Is

An Apple Watch sleep sounds application featuring adaptive audio. It uses a custom audio unit graph for real-time synthesis and integrates with HealthKit for heart rate synchronization.

## Features

- **Procedural Audio Synthesis**: Generates high-quality ambient sounds without large audio files.
- **Adaptive Audio**: Adjusts sound characteristics based on heart rate or environmental noise.
- **Auto-Pause/Resume**: Seamlessly pauses when headphones disconnect and resumes when reconnected.
- **Simple Controls**: Focuses on minimal interaction for sleep-focused use.
