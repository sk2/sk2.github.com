## What This Is

An Apple Watch app that generates ambient noise (white noise, brown noise, and a blended option) for sleeping through Bluetooth headphones. The app prioritizes simplicity with a single play/pause button on the main screen and noise type selection in settings. When headphones disconnect, playback automatically pauses.
