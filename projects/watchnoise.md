## What This Is

**Wave** is an evolutionary ambient audio ecosystem designed to manage the user's sensory environment across rest and work.

1. **StillState (Watch):** An adaptive sleep sounds app for Apple Watch with personalized frequency calibration, heartbeat synchronization, and microphone-based environmental monitoring.
2. **FlowState (Mac):** A productivity-focused menu bar app that links procedural audio to the user's active tasks and "Genetic System" TODO list (planned).
